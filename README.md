# Technical Skills

- Used Express.js to create a Node.js web server.

- Set up GET routes to serve selective JSON data based on parameters (req.param and req.query).

- Heroku to deploy a server and learned about the difference between development and production environments.

- Created POST routes to allow your server to accept incoming data and tested it with Insomnia.

- Learned how and why to use middleware in Express.js.

- Updated your server to serve client-side code for users to interface with.

- Revisited the Fetch API to make requests to your server.

- Modularized and scaled your API by using the Express.js Router.

- Tested application using Jest and helped make it predictable as you scaled up.
